Digital signal processing, BSUIR, 7th semester

Lab_1 - Signal generation:
1.1. Generation of carrier signal of various shapes:
  - sinusoid;
  - pulse with different duty cycle;
  - triangular;
  - sawtooth;
  - noise.
1.2. Generation of polyphonic signals based on the signals from paragraph 1.1 (setting the number of signals and forms).
1.3. Modulation of parameters (amplitude, frequency) of carrier signals obtained in 1.1 using modulating signals of various shapes

Lab_2 - Signal exploration using DFT and FFT:
2.1. Generate a harmonic signal, construct its amplitude and phase spectra, restore the original signal from the obtained spectra;
2.2. Generate a polyharmonic signal, construct its amplitude and phase spectra, restore the original signal from the obtained spectra;
2.3. Implement digital signal filtering (low-pass filter, high-pass filter, band-pass filter).

Lab_3 - Implementation of convolution algorithms for images:
  - Normal blur (frame blur);
  - Gaussian blur;
  - Middle filter;
  - Sobel operator.

Lab_4 - Calculation of auto- and cross-correlation functions of images:
Construct an image of the correlation function.
  - In the case of cross-correlation, search for a fragment in a given image.
